# 🧢 First R Programming Project: Exploring MLB Hitting Stats with R

## 📊 Objective

This project uses **2024 MLB hitting statistics** to explore and visualize team and player performance using the **R programming language**. It's my first full project in R and served as a hands-on way to learn:

- Data import and cleaning (`readr`, `dplyr`)
- Summarization and grouping (`group_by`, `summarize`)
- Data visualization (`ggplot2`)
- Table formatting (`gt`)
- File export (`ggsave`, HTML, CSV, PDF)

---

## ⚾️ Features & Highlights

- 📥 Load and clean raw CSVs of MLB player statistics  
- 📊 Generate **team-level summaries** including WAR, batting average, OBP, and more  
- 🎨 Create dynamic bar plots using **primary + secondary team colors**  
- 📈 Top 10 leaderboards for hitting categories (HR, Hits, Walks, SB)  
- 📋 Publish styled HTML tables using the `gt` package  
- 📁 Save plots and tables to **PDF**, **PNG**, and **HTML** formats  

---

## 🛠️ Skills Practiced

- `tidyverse` fundamentals  
- `ggplot2` for custom plotting  
- `gt` for presentation-quality tables  
- `mapply`, `text_transform` for conditional formatting  
- Data joins and filtering with `left_join()` and `%in%`  
- Exporting high-quality visuals and summaries
